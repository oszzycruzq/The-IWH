                            <p>Personal Growth: Evolving is something that everybody has to do; it can be done mentally, and physically, or, if you believe in God, the connection can become stronger. I've evolved so much that when I look back on something, I feel like it was a dream, in which I enter school and come out of school on the same day. I can honestly say that I have gotten taller, smarter, and wiser. At the start of my schooling, I had bad grades, no friends, and I couldn’t even read right. Therefore, I would suffer and struggle with many things at first because of my dyslexia and the way I looked. I spent the first couple of years working on myself; for example, I worked with my dad so I could have some money for myself, and with that money, I invested in my own book, a gym membership, and even decided to learn how to swim. A smart bunny once said, "Slowly but surely, you win the race." I took my time, and every year I got better grades, got fitter, and felt my confidence rise.  </p>
                            <p> About Me 
                                I am Oswaldo Cruz, the first generation in my family to attend college and the first generation to compete on my school's and other schools' swim teams. I am the second of three children and the only boy, so technically I am the middle child, which is always the best. I am also Mexican, which is a bit harder to deal with at times. I just mentioned some of the things that I do at school and outside, but I didn’t mention that I am having fun doing all these things. I am now 18 years old and can say that I am ready for college and adulthood.</p>
